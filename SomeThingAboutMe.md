I am noob


I am a student learning at FPT University, major is Information Assurance. 

And I fell in love with penetration to find the vulnerability of websites. I want to be an intern in some company like FIS or CyRadar but it is my future.
and in this GitHub, I post my writeup about my process of practice penetration in bWAPP or PortSwigger and maybe in the future will have more and more

Thank you for reading : D
